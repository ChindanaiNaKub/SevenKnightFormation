### 10. Responsive Design ✅
**Desktop (>768px):**
- Multi-column grid layout (auto-fill, min 280px)
- Full-width controls in horizontal layout
- Optimal spacing and readability

**Tablet (≤768px):**
- Single column grid
- Responsive header layout
- Adjusted control spacing

**Mobile (≤480px):**
- Compact controls
- Smaller font sizes
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Full-width select dropdowns

## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
```
CharacterRoster (Parent)
├── CharacterCard (Child) - Multiple instances
└── PetCard (Child) - Multiple instances
```

### State Management
- **Local State**: Search query, sort options, filter options
- **Computed Properties**: 
  - `filteredCharacters` - Search + filter logic
  - `sortedAndFilteredCharacters` - Final sorted list
  - `filteredPets` - Search + filter logic
  - `sortedAndFilteredPets` - Final sorted list
- **Props**: Characters, pets, formation slots
- **Events**: select-character, select-pet

### Sorting Algorithm
- Rarity order: Legendary (SP) → Legendary → Rare → Uncommon → Common
- Alphabetical: Locale-aware string comparison
- Level: Descending numeric sort

### Visual Effects
1. **Glow Animations**: CSS `filter: drop-shadow()` for star glow
2. **Pulse Animation**: Keyframes for Legendary SP items
3. **Hover Transitions**: Smooth color and transform changes
4. **In-Formation State**: Opacity and border color changes

## File Changes

### Modified Files
1. `src/components/character/CharacterRoster.vue` - Complete overhaul with filters/sorting
2. `src/components/character/CharacterCard.vue` - Added availability and enhanced visuals
3. `src/components/character/PetCard.vue` - Added availability and enhanced visuals
4. `src/App.vue` - Pass formation state to CharacterRoster

### No New Files
All features implemented in existing component structure

## User Experience Improvements

### Filtering & Sorting
- Users can quickly find characters by name, rarity, or class
- Multiple filter combinations (e.g., "Legendary Attack characters")
- Visual feedback showing filtered count vs total

### Visual Feedback
- Immediate recognition of rarity through color-coded stars
- Clear indication of which characters are already in formation
- Prevents accidental duplicates
- Animated effects draw attention to high-rarity items

### Accessibility
- Proper labels for all controls
- Keyboard navigation support (native select elements)
- Focus states on interactive elements
- Tooltip hints for icons

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- Computed properties cached until dependencies change
- Efficient array filtering and sorting
- No unnecessary re-renders
- CSS animations use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)

### Scalability
- Handles large character rosters (100+ items)
- Smooth scrolling with virtual scroll consideration
- Minimal DOM updates via Vue's reactive system
