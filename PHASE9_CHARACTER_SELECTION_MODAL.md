## üîß Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const showCharacterModal = ref(false);
const showPetModal = ref(false);
const modalTargetPosition = ref<CharacterPosition>(1);
const placedCharacters = computed(() => { /* ... */ });
```

### Smart Slot Click Handler
- Checks if in selection mode (roster click-to-place)
- If not, opens modal for empty slots
- Existing click-to-place still works when item is selected first

### Props & Events
**CharacterSelectionModal**:
- Props: `characters`, `placedCharacters`, `targetPosition`
- Events: `close`, `select`

**PetSelectionModal**:
- Props: `pets`, `placedPet`
- Events: `close`, `select`

1. **Search functionality**: Add search bar to filter by name
2. **Sorting options**: Sort by tier, rarity, name, etc.
3. **Favorites**: Let users mark favorite characters
4. **Recent selections**: Show recently used characters
5. **Keyboard shortcuts**: ESC to close, arrow keys to navigate
6. **Detailed view**: Click info icon for full character stats
7. **Animation**: Add entry/exit animations for modal

## üì± Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop**: Modal centered, max-width 600px
- **Tablet**: Modal takes more screen space
- **Mobile**: Modal near full-screen, rounded top corners only
