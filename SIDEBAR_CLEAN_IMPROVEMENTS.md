## Design Philosophy

The changes follow these principles:
- **Minimalism** - Remove unnecessary visual effects
- **Clarity** - Better typography hierarchy
- **Consistency** - Uniform spacing and sizing
- **Subtlety** - Less aggressive colors and animations
- **Focus** - Draw attention to important elements (character names, images)

## Before vs After

### Before:
- Heavy hover effects with sliding animations
- Glowing stars and pulsing badges
- Multiple font weights and sizes
- Rounded pill tabs with backgrounds
- SVG icons for buttons
- Larger, more prominent controls

### After:
- Clean hover with simple background change
- Flat star ratings
- Consistent typography
- Underline tabs (more modern)
- Simple text icons
- Subtle, compact controls
- Better use of whitespace

## Result

The sidebar now has a cleaner, more modern appearance that matches the mock design. The interface feels less cluttered while maintaining all functionality.
