# Phase 7: UI/UX Improvements - Side-by-Side Layout

## Overview
Improved the formation builder interface to make it more convenient for users to build formations without excessive scrolling.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Side-by-Side Layout (Desktop)**
- **Formation Area (Left)**: The main formation display with type selector
- **Roster Sidebar (Right)**: Always visible character/pet roster (420px width)
- Users can now see both the formation and available characters simultaneously
- No more scrolling down to find characters!

### 2. **Collapsible Roster Panel**
- Toggle button to collapse/expand the roster sidebar
- When collapsed: Only 40px wide, giving more space for the formation
- When expanded: Full roster with all filters and search
- Smooth animations for better UX

### 3. **Responsive Behavior**

#### Desktop (> 1024px)
- Side-by-side layout with roster on the right
- Roster shows single-column grid for better visibility in sidebar
- Toggle button appears on the left side of the roster

#### Tablet/Mobile (≤ 1024px)
- Stacked layout: Formation on top, roster on bottom
- Roster becomes a bottom panel with max-height
- Multi-column grid in roster when there's space
- Toggle button moves to the top of the roster panel

### 4. **Better Scroll Management**
- Formation area has its own scroll on desktop
- Roster has independent scroll
- No body scroll - everything contained

### 5. **Visual Enhancements**
- Smooth slide-in animations for roster
- Clear visual separation with borders
- Toggle button with intuitive arrow icons
- Better spacing and padding throughout

## Technical Changes

### Modified Files
1. **App.vue**
   - Restructured layout to use flexbox for side-by-side display
   - Added roster collapse state management
   - Updated styles for new layout structure
   - Added responsive breakpoints

2. **CharacterRoster.vue**
   - Updated to work in sidebar context
   - Changed grid layout to single column for desktop sidebar
   - Improved scroll handling
   - Better responsive grid layouts

## User Benefits

✅ **No More Scrolling**: Formation and roster are visible simultaneously  
✅ **More Screen Real Estate**: Collapsible sidebar for when you need more space  
✅ **Better Workflow**: Easier to compare characters and build formations  
✅ **Responsive**: Works great on all screen sizes  
✅ **Smooth Experience**: Nice animations and transitions  

## Inspiration
Based on modern builder interfaces (like AFK Arena and similar games) that use side-by-side layouts for better usability.

## Future Enhancements
- Add keyboard shortcuts to toggle roster
- Remember collapse state in localStorage
- Add quick filters at the top of the roster
- Drag and drop improvements for the new layout
